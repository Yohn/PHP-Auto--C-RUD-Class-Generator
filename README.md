# PHP-Auto--C-RUD-Class-Generator
I want to expand on a class I started years ago to allow for an auto-generated PHP class to do the simple `SELECT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` functions that we need for all database tables.

More to come soon.

Been searching for something thats doing what I want to do, and the only one I found thats close to what I want to do is https://www.phpcodebuilder.com
